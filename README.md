# 🔄 MySQL REPLACE Statement Practice

## 📌 Project Overview
This practice project focuses on mastering the use of the **`REPLACE`** statement in MySQL, applied to realistic datasets from two different industries:  
- **Landscaping & Garden Design** (Lucky Shrub)  
- **Food & Beverage** (Little Lemon Mediterranean Restaurant)  

The `REPLACE` statement is a powerful MySQL command that allows you to insert new data or overwrite existing data based on primary or unique keys. It ensures that records are updated or replaced seamlessly without generating duplicate key errors.
